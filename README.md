# **Big Ben Bot** (as seen on tiktok @aaronr5)

# **About**
Created this bot in about 45 minutes to make a funny tik tok. With that being said don't expect a feature rich bot, it is bare bones and minimal to get the job I needed done in order to make people laugh on tiktok. As of right now I'm not sure if I have plans to add any features/capabilities to this bot. Feel free to use it as is or fork it and make changes/add features. Enjoy!

### Things to note
- This bot is only setup currently to run in one server and that is whatever server you define. You could extend it to work in multiple guilds if you wanted.
- The bot only connects to whatever voice channel you define in the .env.
- You could extend this bot to dynamically check the channels and join whatever channel has members in it. Note though a discord bot client can only connect to ONE voice channel at a time and cannot be in multiple.
- You could do any number of different things with this bot if you have the time and creativity. But as mentioned this was a simple bot I wanted to make quickly for a tik tok and can't make any promises that I personally will develop this bot any further than it's current state.
- **This bot is programmed to run in the timezone of the machine it is running on.** (this could be changed relatively easily but this satisfied my needs of the bot.)
# **Usage Instructions**

## **Prerequisites**

- ### [Node.JS](https://nodejs.org/en/) 14.0.0 or higher.
- ### You will need basic knowledge of node.js and how to navigate via cmd prompt or terminal.

## **Instructions**

Replace the placeholder TOKEN, GUILD_ID, VOICE_CHANNEL_ID, TEXT_CHANNEL_ID(text channel is optional) with your own.
